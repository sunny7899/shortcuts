How to Write Beautiful and Meaningful README.md
Readmefile formatting-

Here I will tell you some interesting tricks that you can use to format the readme file.

As we know this file is present in every project to show the project description. You can also create the file if the file is not already added to your project. This is a very important file because we use this to document the basic things of a project like how to run, what technology we used, how to test the project etc.Here is the list of symbols you can use to format the document-

To format heading:

# The largest heading

## The second-largest heading

###### The smallest heading

To format text:

Style Syntax Keyboard shortcut Example Output

Bold ** ** or __ __ command/control + b **This is bold text** This is bold text

Italic * * or _ _ command/control + i     *This text is italicized* This text is italicized

Strikethrough ~~ ~~ ~~This was mistaken text~~ This was mistaken text

Bold and nested italic ** ** and _ _ **This text is _extremely_ important** This text is extremely important

All bold and italic *** *** ***All this text is important*** All this text is important

To quote the text:

You can quote text with a >.

To add code or command:

Use single backticks(`). The text within the backticks will not be formatted.

To format code or text into its own distinct block: 

use triple backticks. (like pre)

To create the link:

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

Example- 

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
To create your badges-https://shields.io/search your repo here.
Example-#### Link for [demo](link) [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/view-demo-orange)](link)![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Voice-Call-orange) 

To create an unordered list: 

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or * plus space

* Item 1 * Item 2 * Sub Item 1 * Sub Item 2

- Item 1 - Item 2 - Sub Item 1 - Sub Item 2 #^ two spaces

To create an ordered list: 

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

Example1-

1. James Madison

2. James Monroe

3. John Quincy Adams
Example2-

To create a task list: 

preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

- [x] Finish my changes

- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub

- [ ] Open a pull request

To mention any person or team on GitHub/Bitbucket :

Use  @.

To add emoji: 

Use :EMOJICODE:.

Example-

@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:

To add an image in centre-

<p align="center"> <a href="#"> <img src="assets/img/logo.png" width="200px" alt=""/> </a> </p>

How To Write an Engaging Project Description details
Here I will talk about how you can represent your projects so that clients will get to know more about your profile. It is a very important thing to explain your project clearly. For the project that you have done, you can add to your portfolio but you must be aware of all the things from project creation to deployment. If you have a clear understanding then you can write the project description better. If you have done an internship/job write the description with the below points. Following are the points you have to keep in mind before writing a project description

# Project name(App/Title)/Description/Templates/screenshots of all the project pages

# Pre-requisites

# Objective of the project.

# Tech stacks used

# How to build the application.

# How to run the application.

# How to test the application.

# Software tools used.

# Tangible results.

# GIFs showing user flows (if customer-facing)

# Links to web pages or installers for desktop applications.

# Links to code/GitHub repository link

# Domain Name.

# system fonts.

# Logo/icon
