20+ Best Visual Studio Code Extensions for Web Development
Here I will tell you various extensions that will help you in web designing and development. These extensions will speed up your front-end development work and improve your productivity.

Auto Rename Tag:

Auto rename paired HTML tags. You created a <p> tag. Now you want to change it, as well as its enclosing </p> tag to something else. Simply change one and the others will follow.

HTML CSS Support:

CSS support for HTML documents. This is useful for getting some neat syntax highlighting and code suggestions so that CSS only makes you want to quit coding a couple of times a day.

HTML Snippets: depraceted now

Useful code snippets. Another nice time saver. Pair this with Emmet and you barely ever have to type real HTML again.

Babel ES6/ES7:

Adds JavaScript Babel syntax colouring. If you are working on Babel, this will make it much easier to differentiate what is going on in your code.

Bracket Pair Colorizer: depracated now

Adds colours to brackets for easier block visualization. This is helpful for those who forget to close brackets or parentheses accurately. These are common bugs that you can correct using this extension.

This extension is deprecated as this functionality is now built-in to VS Code. Configure these settings to use this functionality.

@id:editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled @id:editor.guides.bracketPairs

ESLint, TSlint:

Integrates ESLint into Visual Studio Code. This is handy for getting hints about bugs as you are writing your code and, depending on your configuration, it can help enforce a good coding style.

Guides:

Adds extra guidelines to code. This is an additional visual cue to make sure that you are closing your brackets correctly. If you can’t tell, I’m a very visual person.

JavaScript Console Utils:

Makes for easier console logging. This service makes it easy to create useful console.log() statements.

Code Spell Checker:

Spelling checker that accounts for camelCase. Another frequent source of bugs is fat-thumbing a variable or function name. This extension will look for uncommon words and is good about accounting for the way we write things in JavaScript.

GitLens:

Makes it easier to see when, and by whom, changes were made. Easier to find out which code gets broken you can correct this. Before installing this you have to install git first from https://git-scm.com/

Path Intellisense:

File path autocompletion. used for importing things from other files. It makes navigating your file tree a breeze.

Prettier:

Automatic code Formatter. Prettier will indent your code and many things for you much faster, and better than you ever could on your own.

VSCode-Icons:

Adds icons to the file tree. If viewing your file structure hurts your eyes, this might help. There is an icon for any kind of file you are making which will make it easier to distinguish what you are looking at.

Quokka.js :

runs your code immediately as you type.

Indent Rainbow:

It colourizes each tab indentation to make it more readable. It contains rainbow colours by default. you can also configure it according to your understanding.

Todo Highlighter:

It highlights and reminds you about fixing code and other annotations within your code. you just need to write todo. it scans your code aND d colour highlights your source where the tag exists.

Import Cost:

You can check whether you are importing the entire library or just a particular utility.

REST Client:

It allows you to send an HTTP request and view the response in Visual Studio Code directly.

Auto Close Tag:

It supports HTML. The elements will get automatically closed when the opening tag is typed.

Indenticator:

This is also used to provide indentation to the code. configure it according to the indent guide.
